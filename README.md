## What is Cardios?

It's a super simple electron app. Take notes and that's it. What else could you want?


- Quick Note: Cardios is not yet deployed. The only way to mess around with is is cloning and builing with running NPM start.

## Context

Built with Electron, this app is mostly pure JS. No frontend framework here (regrettably). One day I hope to get some time to re-write the whole thing in Vue.

- Another Note: This was developed before I truly understood the complexities of JS and before I knew how to properly utilise it's possibilities/ES6.
